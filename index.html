   <h1>Data: As a tool to fight COVID-19</h1><br>
    <h3>Data is a collection of numbers to give some information. The collection, recording and presentation of data helps us to organize our experiences and draw inferences and conclutions from them. Data has great power.</h3><br>
    <p id="intro">There are many different ways Data helps us in our daily life situations, Data also helps us in fighting any new and unknown diseases. You might be thinking that how does Data help in fighting a disease? Well, we have the answer to that question! Some ways Data helps us in fighting a disease are:-</p><br>
    <ol class="data">
    <li class="ways">1. How the disease spreads</li><br>
        <p>Data helps us to find out how and how fast the disease speads through out our whole body. Data also helps us to know which part or organ of the human body is more or most affected by the disease. It helps us to find out how fast or slow the disease would spread through out the world too.</p><br>
    <li class="ways">2. Which gender is affected more</li><br>
        <p>Data helps us in finding out which gender is more affected or prone to the disease. Some or most diseases affect all genders and ages. But, we wouldn't know that for sure if it wasn't for the doctors who collect data and information on a new and unknown disease to make it more known to us, and warn us about its symtoms and after affects.</p><br>
    <li class="ways">3. Which age group is more prone to the disease</li><br>
        <p>Data helps us in knowing which age group is more or mostly affected by the disease or diseases. Some diseases only affect old people like your grand mother and grand father, but some diseases only affect small and young children. Thanks to data we now have more information on all the diseases that have been seen and experienced until today and surely data will defintely help us more in the future too.</p><br>
    <li class="ways">4. Which medicine is more effective</li><br>
        <p>We just saw so many ways data can help us in fighting a disease. Well, here's one more way data helps us in fighting a disease and always will help us in this way. Data helps us in finding out which medicine or vaccine is most affective in curing or healing the disease. There are so many medicines and vaccines now but now all of them work in healing every disease, there are specific medicines for specific diseases like we just got a new vaccine for COVID but it doesn't work for all ages.</p><br>
